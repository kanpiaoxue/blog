 <p>You have Code Recommenders installed. The proposal with percentage is coming from that, and the proposal without the percentage is coming from JDT.</p> 
 <p>Essentially there are more than one completion engines installed - see Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Editor &gt; Content Assist. The same method is being offered by more than one engine. While this explains why the duplicates are there, I do not have a workaround or a solution in mind.</p> 
 <p>Go to Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Editor -&gt; Content Assist -&gt; Advanced</p> 
 <p>To see no duplicates in your suggestions, have the assist list checked as shown below.</p> 
 <p>(Tested in Eclipse - Kepler Version)</p> 
 <p>Java Content Assist Advanced Preferences</p> 
 <p>If you have checked "Java Type Proposals" and "Java Non-Type Proposals" then you will see duplicates in your suggestions.</p>
